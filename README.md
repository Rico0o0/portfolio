# <ins> Computational Physics projects: </ins>

This repository serves as a showcase of my coding projects that I have undergone as part of my undergraduate Physics degree, alongside demonstrating new projects that serve to push my creativity and coding knowledge.

## <ins> Project 1- Numerical integration of differential equations:  </ins>
The main aim of this project was to investigate the effectiveness of models of spring-mass systems for various damping coefficients and forces over a small time period.
- Objective- solve the equation of motion for a damped harmonic oscillator:

$$
mx^{''}(t)+bx^{'}(t)+kx(t)=F(t)
$$

- Methods implemented:
  - Euler method. 
  -  Improved Euler method.
  -  Verlet method.
  -  Euler-Cromer method.
 
- Key features:
  - Visualisation of the motion of a spring-mass system.
  - Allowing for adjustable initial parameters.
  - Investigation of resonance and sudden applied force scenarios.

- Technical skills:
   - Understanding the Physics behind multiple varied methods, as well as the limitations to justify deviations from a solution.
   - Accurate error propagation to signify precise fits.
   - Libraries used: numpy, matplotlib.
